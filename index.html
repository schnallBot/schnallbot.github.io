                    Hi there! I'm Josh Ho and this is my personal website. I majored in Computer Science at
                    <span class="text-decor">Virginia Tech</span> and I'm currently a software developer at
                    <span class="text-decor">Epic</span>. Here's my
                    <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11T2OVH0iD9b15EY1f5RlOqJ2Aa_vV6a1/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">resume</a>!

                <h2>ii. missions &#9737</h2>
                <p>
                    Here are the places I've worked at:
                </p>
                <h3><a href="https://www.epic.com/" target="_blank">Epic</a> | aug 2022&ndash;now</h3>
                <p class="work-proj-summary">
                    I'm a <span class="text-decor">software developer</span> at Epic based in Madison, Wisconsin. I create tools that doctors, nurses, and other clinicians use to care for their patients, with a specialty in cardiology. My big project right now is a tool for cardiovascular clinicians to document <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/17606-vascular-ultrasound" target="_blank">vascular ultrasound</a> procedures.
                </p>
                <h3><a href="https://agroseek.cs.vt.edu/" target="_blank">AgroSeek</a> | may 2021&ndash;may 2022</h3>
                <p class="work-proj-summary">
                    I worked as an <span class="text-decor">undergraduate research assistant</span> on the AgroSeek Project, alongside faculty
                    and peers at my university, to develop software for processing and analyzing metagenomic data (DNA), to be used by students
                    and researchers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    And here are some of my projects:
                </p>
                <h3><a href="https://github.com/schnallBot/simple-user-manager" target="_blank">Simple User Management System</a> | jan 2022</h3>
                <p class="work-proj-summary">
                    A simple user management system I put together while learning Node.js, Express, and MySQL. It currently supports viewing
                    users, searching for users, showing only starred users, adding users, and some individual user functions: star/unstar, view
                    in detail, edit, and delete.
                </p>
                <h3><span class="text-decor">Personal Web Server</span> | dec 2021</h3>
                <p class="work-proj-summary">
                    I worked with a teammate to create a simple web server in C for my final project in CS3214 - Computer Systems.
                    When launched, it is able to handle basic HTTP transactions and supports file serving, mp4 streaming, and
                    authentication, and implements threading to serve multiple clients concurrently. Personally my favorite school
                    project.
                </p>
                <h3><span class="text-decor">Ultimate Grapher</span> | dec 2020&ndash;jan 2021</h3>
                <p class="work-proj-summary">
                    When I was just a budding computer science student, I worked with some friends to develop a graphing
                    calculator-esque program which takes in coordinate points and utilizes matrix operations to generate a matching
                    function, and displays its graph onto a GUI. Developed in Java and Python.

                <h2>iii. beyond the infinite &#9672</h2>
                <p>
                    When I'm not telling computers what to do, I like to bike, hike, go on excessively long walks, build mechanical keyboards, discover new music, and collect credit card rewards. I enjoy both thought-provoking and mindless media. My dream is to retire early and spend the rest of my life in a massage chair.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Needless to say, I think 2001: A Space Odyssey is a neat movie. Its warning about our reliance on machines and how that could go wrong motivates me to help create a future where technologies like HAL-9000 don't go bonkers.
