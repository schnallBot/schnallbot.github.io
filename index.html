                    Hi there! I'm Josh Ho and this is my space-odyssey-inspired personal website. Currently I'm an undergrad student at
                    <span class="text-decor">Virginia Tech</span> majoring in Computer Science. I'm also an incoming software developer at
                    <span class="text-decor">Epic Systems</span>. Here's my

                    I'm excited to begin work at Epic Systems in Madison soon after I graduate. I will be working as a software developer,
                    writing and maintaining code that healthcare professionals around the world depend on to care for their patients.

                    I'm working on the AgroSeek Project with faculty and peers at my university to develop software for processing and
                    analyzing metagenomic data (DNA), to be used by students and researchers. My responsibilities include writing
                    back-end scripts (mostly in Python), testing, and creating documentation.

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/schnallBot/simple-user-manager" target="_blank">Simple User Management System</a> | jan 2022</h3>
                <p class="work-proj-summary">
                    A simple user management system I put together while learning Node.js, Express, and MySQL. It currently supports viewing
                    users, searching for users, showing only starred users, adding users, and some individual user functions: star/unstar, view
                    in detail, edit, and delete. It is not currently in deployment, but be on the lookout &#128064
                </p>
                <h3><a href="https://github.com/schnallBot/CS3214-personal-server" target="_blank">Personal Web Server</a> | dec 2021</h3>
                <p class="work-proj-summary">
                    I worked with a teammate to create a simple web server in C for my final project in CS3214 - Computer Systems.
                    When launched, it is able to handle basic HTTP transactions and supports file serving, mp4 streaming, and
                    authentication, and implements threading to serve multiple clients concurrently. Personally my favorite school
                    project.

                <h3><span class="text-decor">Ultimate Grapher</span> | dec 2020&ndash;jan 2021</h3>
                <p class="work-proj-summary">
                    When I was just a budding computer science student, I worked with some friends to develop a graphing
                    calculator-esque program which takes in coordinate points and utilizes matrix operations to generate a matching
                    function, and displays its graph onto a GUI. Developed in Java and Python.

                <p>
                    When I'm not coding, I like to bike, hike, go on excessively long walks, draw, work out, discover new music, and
                    do personal finance and investing stuff. If I find any random topic interesting, I like to deep-dive into it and
                    learn all that I can about it. My dream is to 
                    <span class="text-decor">bike across the continental United States</span>, coast-to-coast.

                    Needless to say, I think 2001: A Space Odyssey is a neat movie. Its warning about our reliance on machines and how
                    that could go wrong is captivating, and inspires me to help shape a future where technologies like HAL-9000 don't
                    go bonkers.
